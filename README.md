# Corona-Info
Coronavirus Information Python GUI

This basic GUI can be used to view news and data on the COVID-19 pandemic. This GUI was made with tkinter, the default GUI builder in python3.
tkinter is a tool with many quirks, problems, and missing features which make it hard to reccomend to someone wanting to make a professional project.
To anyone wanting to use tkinter, I would heavily suggest using classes as tkinter apps can quickly become hard to read.
I used this project to explore many different avenues of data collection and display to help bolster my skills.

Features:
  1. View tweets of certain users posting news, stories, or opnions about the situation
  2. View the latest headlines from the USA about coronavirus
  3. View data (from a limited data set) about the state of the situation
  4. Rating system, Users can rate the app and have that data stored in a xlsx file for future use
  
  Tools Used:
    python, tkinter, OpenBlender, openpyxl, tweepy, newsapi, pandas
    
  Problems:
    OpenBlender requires payment to download large datasets which I didn't want to pay for, This made the data section weak, and also
    ruined the possibllity of making graphs.
